## Introduction

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. This game is written completely in Python, and represents an exercise in combining some key basic concepts of Python (as part of the AiCore course).

## Installation instructions

To install this hangman game clone and enter the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Ciaran-Mu/hangman.git
cd hangman
```
Then run the most recent milestone file
```
python milestone_4.py
```

## Usage instructions

Instructions to enter a gues of one letter will appear in the terminal. Enter one letter as a guess and the output will tell you if it is contained within the random word chosen or not.

## File structure

The milestone_x.py files represent iterations of the hangman project. Each is standalone and the only dependency is the 'random' python module.
